# boot-polymer
Spring Boot application using Polymer 2.0

This demo application demonstrates how to combine **spring boot** with the latest **Polymer** library (current 2.0, but I'll update the application when new version is released)   

## Usage

### Build
```
mvn clean install
```

### Run the application
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```
Open http://localhost:8080/
